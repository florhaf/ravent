        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
		
		<p>Gemster Group Inc. ("Gemster") operates several websites including gemsterapp.com and gemsterblog.com and mobile applications. It is Gemster's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites and applications (“The Service” or “Services”).</p>

		<h1>Service Visitors</h1>
		
		<p>Like most website operators, Gemster collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Gemster's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Gemster's visitors use its Services. From time to time, Gemster may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its Services.</p>
<p>Gemster also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on Gemster posts. Gemster only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>

<h1>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h1>

<p>Certain visitors to Gemster's Services choose to interact with Gemster in ways that require Gemster to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Gemster gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. Gemster does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Service-related activities.</p>

<h1>Aggregated Statistics</h1>

<p>Gemster may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its Services. Gemster may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Gemster does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

<h1>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h1>

<p>Gemster discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Gemster's behalf or to provide features available at Gemster's Services, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Gemster's Services, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Gemster will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Gemster discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Gemster believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Gemster, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Gemster Service, Gemster may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Gemster and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Gemster takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

<h1>Cookies</h1>

<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's internet capable device, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Gemster uses cookies to help Gemster identify and track visitors, their usage of Gemster Services, and their access preferences. Gemster visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their devices should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Gemster's Services, with the drawback that certain features of Gemster's Services may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

<h1>Ads</h1>

<p>Ads appearing on any of our Services may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Gemster and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

<h1>Privacy Policy Changes</h1>

<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Gemster may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Gemster's sole discretion. Gemster encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
