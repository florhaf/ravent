        <h1>What is Gemster?</h1>

        <p>Gemster is the ultimate event app for finding out what is going on near you and what you could be doing.</p>

        <p>Gemster was built around a simple fundamental premise: more and more local events today are promoted via Facebook.  Chances are you won't find them on Ticketmaster, Eventful, and other large websites.  Main reason: a lot of these events are cheap (or free) and the organizers can't afford to promote them on the mega-websites.  Yet they promise to be every bit as fun as the next Lady Gaga concert you're planning to go to (or well, almost as fun ;-)  Don't worry, Gemster also finds out all the larger events as well so it is your one-stop shop for all there is to do near you!</p>

        <p>Gemster uses a P2P system to aggregate all public Facebook events that are part of its users profiles.  This means you have access to hundreds of events happening near you at any one time.</p>

        <p>Gemster helps you uncover all those fun local events happening around you, all those gems you’ve been missing out on.  Gemster helps you Know where to go.</p>

        <h1>Is Gemster available WorldWide?</h1>

        <p>YES ! as long as we have users in your region, we have events in your area.</p>

        <h1>Who uses Gemster?</h1>

        <p>Anyone who's ever wondered what do to when they've had no time to plan, their friends are lazy, or just don't want to do the same old thing a third week-end in a row.</p>

        Why is Gemster different than [insert other event app here]?

        <p>Because we aggregate all public Facebook events to make sure you see as many things as possible around you.  Today, there are many more events promoted on Facebook than almost any other platform.  Bars, clubs, DJ's, etc. that are having special events would rather promote on their Facebook pages since they already have a loyal following and it's much cheaper than any other platform out there.  With Gemster, we are helping you find all those events you didn't know existed, all those gems!</p>

            <h1>What are gems?  Why should I drop a gem?</h1>

        <p>Gems represent events on Gemster but is also a ranking system.</p>

        <p>In the map, gems represent events.</p>

        <p>In the event profile, you can use gems to rank the event (like a point or star system).</p>

        <p>The most important gems though are those you "drop".  You can drop a gem in any event profile to tell the promoter you are excited to participate in that event.  To recognize your gem dropping efforts (FYI: it's really not that hard to drop a gem), the promoter will give you free stuff!  It's a win/win for everyone really.</p>

        <p>We are working hard to get more and more promoters recognize your gem dropping abilities so keep looking for those events as we add them!</p>

                <h1>Why do I have to sign up via Facebook?</h1>

        <p>Gemster's engine is based on P2P.  All the events you see are those public Facebook events in the community's calendar.</p>

        <p>When logging in via Facebook, Gemster will add all the public events you've been invited to on Facebook to the Gemster platform.  It's your way to give back to the Gemster community.  You are helping everyone find more gems around them!</p>

                    <h1>Wait, ALL my events?  That concerns me!</h1>

        <p>No no, don't worry, we only aggregate your PUBLIC events.  So if you're invited to a 5-person private birthday dinner, it won't be on Gemster.  We have the utmost respect for your privacy and if you have any issues with Gemster, please do not hesitate to contact us at contact@gemsterapp.com.</p>

                        <h1>Will the app be available for Android/non-iOS devices?</h1>

        <p>As soon as the iOS app is released and stable, we will begin working on other smartphone platforms.  We want to make sure everyone out there can share and discover gems all around them, regardless of platforms so stay tuned, we will get to you shortly!</p>

                            <h1>How can I contact Team Gemster?</h1>

        <p>You can email us directly at contact@gemsterapp.com</p>
